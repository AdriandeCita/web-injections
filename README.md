A dump of useful injections I use to enhance or alter functionality on some websites.

### How does it work

Just inject it into the page using an addon like (Code-Injector)[https://github.com/Lor-Saba/Code-Injector].

### Caveats

Most of the code relies on DOM structure, which means it's quite fragile. Don't expect it to be working out of the box.
